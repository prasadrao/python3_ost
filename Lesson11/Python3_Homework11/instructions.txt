Here are your instructions:


Create a Python3_Homework11 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. In the Python3_Homework11/src folder, copy property_address.py and test_property_address.py from the last project.

property_address.py must append messages such as the following to a logfile named property_address.log each time test_property_address.py is run:

property_address.log:
2011-12-05 19:36:14,970 - ERROR - state - STATE exception

2011-12-05 19:36:14,970 - INFO - __init__ - Creating a new address

2011-12-05 19:36:14,986 - ERROR - zip_code - ZIPCODE exception
Note: Your date and time values will of course vary.

Submit property_address.py and test_property_address.py when they are working to your satisfaction.
