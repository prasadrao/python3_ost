Create a Python3_Homework13 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. In the Python3_Homework13/src folder, create a program named mathquiz.py. In this program, you will create a math quiz. This quiz will ask the user five addition questions adding random integers between 1 and 10 inclusive. Each answer will be timed so you can generate the following time results:
•Time for each question
•Total time for all questions
•Average time per question

This program needs to generate random numbers using Python's random library.

Your project should meet the following conditions:

You must include a working test_mathquiz.py unittest file that tests at least one function. Each time the test runs, it must present random integers.

Your code must generate output that looks like this:
What is the sum of 6 and 6? 12
12 is right!
What is the sum of 5 and 4? 9
9 is right!
What is the sum of 4 and 2? 6
6 is right!
What is the sum of 1 and 1? 2
2 is right!
What is the sum of 9 and 2? 111
111 is wrong!
Question #1 took about 1 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #2 took about 1 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #3 took about 1 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #4 took about 2 seconds to complete and was right.
Question #5 took about 2 seconds to complete and was wrong.
You took 9 seconds to finish the quiz
Your average time was 1.8 seconds per question
