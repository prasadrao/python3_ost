Here are your instructions:


Create a Python3_Homework08 project and assign it to your Python3_Homework working set. In the Python3_Homework08/src folder, create a program named wiretimes.py that reads the wireshark.bin data file dumped from the wireshark program (to get it, right-click the link http://courses.oreillyschool.com/Python3/software/wireshark.bin, select Save Target As, and save the file to your Python3_Homework08/src folder.). The file begins with a header:

Wireshark file header:
 guint32 magic_number; /* magic number */
  guint16 version_major; /* major version number */
  guint16 version_minor; /* minor version number */
  gint32 thiszone; /* GMT to local correction */
  guint32 sigfigs; /* accuracy of timestamps */
  guint32 snaplen; /* max length of captured packets, in octets */
  guint32 network; /* data link type */

Each packet is then preceded by a four-entry header:
 guint32 ts_sec; /* timestamp seconds */
 guint32 ts_usec; /* timestamp microseconds */
 guint32 incl_len; /* number of octets of packet saved in file */
 guint32 orig_len; /* actual length of packet */

For more detailed information about the wireshark dump file format, see http://wiki.wireshark.org/Development/LibpcapFileFormat.

Print the timestamp for each packet in seconds and microseconds.

Submit wiretimes.py when it is working to your satisfaction.


UTF-8 has a way of keeping the first 128 ASCII chars to 1 byte, clever that way.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8

Since Python source code is Unicode, you may use Chinese characters for all names outside the Standard Library,
which is supposed to be remain English (per Guido).  Keywords are of course English.  But that's a fairly small
vocabulary, with much of the code remaining in some native character set.  Of course one could fork Python to
have keywords not in English but at the cost of breaking compatibility with the standard compilers.
